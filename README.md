# Distribution Change

A project to explore the multi-dimensional nature of species' distribution changes

## Main repository

Analysis of Odonata data to explore change. 
+ 00 functions - core functions of the distribution metrics and some helper functions
+ 01 getModels - code to pull in the data from the occupancy models
+ 02 rangeMetrics (occu prop, area, extent, saturation)
+ 03 fragmentation 
+ 04 core and marginal
+ 05 relationships (plotting code for Fig. 3 - AOO/EOO, Fig. 4 - Clump/Sat, Fig. 5 - Core/Margine)
+ 06 spatial variability (SI plots on colonizations/extinctions, range margin effects, latitudinal extents)
+ 07 initial effects - effects of initial area for SI
+ 08 regression - formal test of relationships
